          <h3 id="about-text-head">We're a tabletop stream that loves the game, the stories, and each other.</h3>
          <p>Our journey began several years ago. Since then, we've crafted a realm of fantasy, characters, and boundless adventure known as Mythscara. Our close-knit group of best friends embarked on this journey together, and it has been an experience filled with laughter, intense roleplay, and joy. But we're more than just players; we're storytellers, creators, and passionate gamers.</p>
          <p>We want to make one thing clear: we're not here to be celebrities or influencers. We're a group of genuine, lifelong friends who share a deep love for roleplaying and storytelling.</p>
